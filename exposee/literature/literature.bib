abstract = {The software industry is growing at a phenomenal rate. We have a never-ending desire to solve more and more complex problems with software. As systems become more complex, it becomes increasingly difficult to determine user needs. Early determination of user needs is critical to risk reduction. The best way to assess what users really need is to give them a “working” system. Software prototyping is the process of producing a partial system early in the development cycle to ascertain these needs. This article provides a variety of taxonomies for software prototypes, explores criteria for determining when prototyping is a good idea, surveys available techniques, and describes some case studies of using prototyping with successful results.}

With a rapidly growing number of companies, the use of low-code solutions can be a significant step forward in creating essential business applications. This paper describes the use of the Aurea BPM low-code platform for automating business processes in manufacturing.}
