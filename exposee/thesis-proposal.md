Challenges - (Does not have qualitative/quantitave analysis)

# Research Questions

# Approach to solve research question
Design science research https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Design-Science-Research-general-steps-Vaishnavi-Kuechler-2004_fig1_50859660

# Foundations
Explain prototyping and low code or Model based software engineering

# Related work
Compare challenges against existing approaches in some matrix/graphics

# Solution ideas
Can add graphics

# Preliminary structure of the final thesis

# Timeline and work packages
Adding a gnaat chart (usually wrting thesis and developing code go hand in hand)


# Solution Ideas

- Software Prototyping https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_prototyping
- Low Code approach https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platform
- Drag and drop the UI elements
- Modelling and validating using graph/tree structure https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642318300017
- Experimenting the UI elements
- Quantitative analysis and significance test (determining which of the tests are more useful)
- Qualitative analysis
