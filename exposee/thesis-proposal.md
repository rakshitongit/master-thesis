# Topic (Prototyping using Model Based Software Engineering)

# Introduction
Motivation of the topic, problems and challenges (problem statement)
Low code,

Challenges - (Does not have qualitative/quantitave analysis)

# Research Questions

# Approach to solve research question
Design science research https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Design-Science-Research-general-steps-Vaishnavi-Kuechler-2004_fig1_50859660

# Foundations
Explain prototyping and low code or Model based software engineering

# Related work
Compare challenges against existing approaches in some matrix/graphics

# Solution ideas
Can add graphics

# Preliminary structure of the final thesis

# Timeline and work packages
Adding a gnaat chart (usually wrting thesis and developing code go hand in hand)


# Solution Ideas

- Software Prototyping https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_prototyping
- Low Code approach https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platform
- Drag and drop the UI elements
- Modelling and validating using graph/tree structure https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642318300017
- Experimenting the UI elements
- Quantitative analysis and significance test (determining which of the tests are more useful)
- Qualitative analysis

# Solution Ideas
- Build
-- Visualising the Prototypes
-- Modelling the Prototypes
-- Creating Experiments and Tasks

- Measure
-- Prototype for testing
Having a submodel/visualisation of that model to the users for collecting the information
-- Measuring Experiments and Tasks 

- Learn
-- Analyses (qualitative, quantitative and task analysis)
-- Improve the prototype

- For an experiment it could have one task for all the user groups.

- Low Code

- Task based Usability Testing
(why they are necessary / motivation)
-- Tasks
-- Task Scenarios
1. Make the Task Realistic
2. Make the Task Actionable
3. Avoid Giving Clues and Describing the Steps (autonomy)
