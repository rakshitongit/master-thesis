We plan to have our final thesis structure approximately in the following format: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Introduction
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Motivation
		\item Problem Statement
		\item Research Approach (DSR Method)
		\item Solution Approach
	\end{itemize}
	\item Background/Foundation (Here, explain in detail the topics needed for developing a basis for the thesis. Some of the topics include:)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Continuous Experimentation
		\item Low code / No Code techniques
		\item Model-based Software engineering
		\item UI Prototyping
		\item Crowdsourcing
		\item Task-based Usability Testing
	\end{itemize}
	\item Related Work
	\begin{itemize}
		\item State-of-the-art research
		\item Defining requirements
		\item Comparison
	\end{itemize}
	\item Design (Design principles)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Build
		\item Measure
		\item Learn
	\end{itemize}
	\item Solution Implementation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Design Features
		\item Architecture
