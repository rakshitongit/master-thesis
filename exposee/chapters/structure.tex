We plan to have our final thesis structure approximately in the following format: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Introduction
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Motivation
		\item Problem Statement
		\item Research Approach
		\item Solution Approach
	\end{itemize}
	\item Related Work
	\begin{itemize}
		\item State-of-the-art research
		\item Defining requirements / Research Questions
		\item Comparison
	\end{itemize}
	\item Background/Foundation (Here, explain in detail the topics needed for developing a basis for the thesis. Some of the topics include:)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Continuous Experimentation
		\item Low code / No Code techniques
		\item Model-based Software engineering
		\item Data-driven Engineering
		\item A/B Testing, etc. 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Design (As per LEAN development technique)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Build
		\item Measure
		\item Learn
	\end{itemize}
	\item Implementation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Architecture
		\item Implementation of Prototypes, Experiments and Tasks
