\chapter{Work Packages and Timeline}
\label{chap:wps}
In this section, we define the work packages, and timeline to fulfill the defined tasks in the next months.

\section{Work Packages}
We divide our thesis into Work packages (WP) or Tasks.
This can be used to track the progress of the thesis and get feedback.

\paragraph{WP1 (Introduction):} In this package, we would like to start by introducing the topic, identifying the problems by defining the problem statement, and finally, defining our research and solution approach.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Motivation
    \item Problem Statement
    \item Research and Solution Approach
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{WP2 (Related Work):} Here, we would like to find some State-of-the-art research and compare them with the research questions or the requirements that we define for the thesis.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item State-of-the-art research
    \item Defining requirements / Research Questions
    \item Comparison
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{WP3 (Foundation):} In this package, we would like to define some terminologies according to the research (e.g., Continous Experimentation, Low-Code, etc.)

\paragraph{WP4 (Design):} Here, we would like to design our thesis as per the LEAN development cycle, containing Build, Measure and Learn phases.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Build
    \item Measure
    \item Learn
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{WP5 (Implementation):} In this package, we would like to implement the prototypes by developing the meta-models, defining the architectures, and coding them for visualization of the prototypes.
We would also conduct experiments on the users and measure and learn from their feedback.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Architecture
    \item Creating meta models and concrete models for database 
    \item Visualization of the Prototypes 
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{WP6 (Testing the prototypes):} In this package, we would test our prototypes by creating the experiments and the tasks for the users and measuring feedback from them.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Deployment on Server using docker\footnote{Docker: \url{https://www.docker.com/}}
    \item Create and assign experiments, and tasks to the users 
    \item Analyze the measurements
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{WP7 (Evaluation):} Every research has Opportunities, Risks, and Limitations. In this WP, we would be discussing them.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Opportunities
    \item Risks
    \item Limitations
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{WP8 (Conclusion):} Here, we conclude the thesis and write the scope for future work.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Conclusion
    \item Future work
\end{enumerate}
