\chapter{Work Packages and Timeline}
In this section, define work packages and milestones you are going to fulfill in the next months.
Afterwards, create a timeline depicting the starting and ending date for each work package and milestone.
You can use a nice Gantt chart (see examples below). Proper list of work packages and dates is also enough.
