\chapter{Related Work} \label{chap:csr}

This section considers some existing frameworks and compares them to our solution approach. 
We will only consider major features and neglect minor technical differences and implementation details. 
We will focus on the topics like \texttt{UI Prototyping}, \texttt{Crowdsourcing}, \texttt{Data-driven approaches}, \texttt{Continuous Experiments} and \texttt{Model-based approaches}. 

For example, you could write about: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Figma\footnote{https://www.figma.com/}
	\item Others\footnote{https://webflow.com/blog/prototyping-tools} 	
	\item \dots
\end{itemize}

Note: \emph{This template is just an example.} You can of course combine Sections~\ref{chap:intro} and~\ref{chap:csr} into one section or use a different structure.
