This section considers some existing frameworks and compares them to our solution approach. 
We will only consider major features and neglect minor technical differences and implementation details. 
We will focus on the topics like \texttt{UI Prototyping}, \texttt{Crowdsourcing}, \texttt{Data-driven approaches}, \texttt{Continuous Experiments} and \texttt{Model-based approaches}.
