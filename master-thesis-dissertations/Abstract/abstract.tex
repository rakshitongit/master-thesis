The user interface (UI) layer is one of the essential aspects of software applications since it associates end-users with the functionality.
For interactive applications, the usability and convenience of the UI are essential factors for achieving user acceptability.
Therefore, the software is successful from the end user's perspective if it facilitates good interaction between users and the system.
