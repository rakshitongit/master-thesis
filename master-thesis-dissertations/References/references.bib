abstract = {The software industry is growing at a phenomenal rate. We have a never-ending desire to solve more and more complex problems with software. As systems become more complex, it becomes increasingly difficult to determine user needs. Early determination of user needs is critical to risk reduction. The best way to assess what users really need is to give them a “working” system. Software prototyping is the process of producing a partial system early in the development cycle to ascertain these needs. This article provides a variety of taxonomies for software prototypes, explores criteria for determining when prototyping is a good idea, surveys available techniques, and describes some case studies of using prototyping with successful results.}

abstract = "Low-code is a growing development approach supported by many platforms. It fills the gap between business and IT by supporting the active involvement of non-technical domain experts, named Citizen Developer, in the application development lifecycle.Low-code introduces new concepts and characteristics. However, it is not investigated yet in academic research to point out the existing challenges and opportunities when testing low-code software. This shortage of resources motivates this research to provide an explicit definition to this area that we call it Low-Code Testing.In this paper, we initially conduct an analysis of the testing components of five commercial Low-Code Development Platforms (LCDP) to present low-code testing advancements from a business point of view. Based on the low-code principles as well as the result of our analysis, we propose a feature list for low-code testing along with possible values for them. This feature list can be used as a baseline for comparing low-code testing components and as a guideline for building new ones. Accordingly, we specify the status of the testing components of investigated LCDPs based on the proposed features. Finally, the challenges of low-code testing are introduced considering three concerns: the role of citizen developer in testing, the need for high-level test automation, and cloud testing. We provide references to the state-of-the-art to specify the difficulties and opportunities from an academic perspective. The results of this research can be used as a starting point for future research in low-code testing area.",
