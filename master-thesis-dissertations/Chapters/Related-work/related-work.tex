A review informed the design and evaluation of our tool of existing tools and research technologies in UI prototyping and usability testing. 
This chapter will present a comprehensive overview of the related work in two sections. 
The first section (see section \ref{section:related-word:tools}) will discuss the tools and state-of-the-art research technologies commonly used for UI prototyping and UI split testing. 
We will provide an in-depth analysis of the strengths and limitations of each tool and highlight its unique features and functionalities.
The next section (see section \ref{section:related-word:comparison}) focuses on comparing our tool with the existing ones. 
We compare different \ac{dr}s we developed in chapter \ref{chap:design} with the other available tools. 
The comparison will help us identify the gaps and limitations of existing tools and evaluate our tool's uniqueness and innovation. 
Through this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the existing tools and technologies and highlight our tool's contributions to the field of UI prototyping and UI split testing.

\section{Current Tools}
\label{section:related-word:tools}
This section will explore some of the existing softwares or \ac{ra} available in the market.
We have identified some existing tools that are commonly used for UI prototyping and A/B testing.
UX designers widely use these tools to create and test UI prototypes with users. 
Some of these tools are industry-standard and have been around for many years, while others are relatively new.
We will briefly describe each tool's key features and capabilities to provide a comprehensive understanding of the tools we will be comparing.

\paragraph{\ac{ra}1 Figma:} 
Figma\footnote{Website for Figma: \url{https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040314193-Guide-to-prototyping-in-Figma}} is a widely popular user interface design tool designers and design teams use for prototyping, UI design, and collaborative work. 
It has gained popularity due to its versatile features, user-friendly interface, and real-time collaboration capabilities, making it a go-to tool for many designers.
Figma has a broad range of features that allow designers to create complex UI designs easily. 
It includes an extensive library of UI elements, customizable templates, and vector networks to make designing more manageable. 
Additionally, it offers prototyping features that allow designers to simulate complex user interactions and animations, which can help designers validate their decisions quickly. 
Figma is an excellent tool for teams working on the same design project, as it offers real-time collaboration. 
Designers can work together on the same design file, share feedback, and update the design in real-time, making it an efficient and collaborative tool for design teams.

\paragraph{\ac{ra}2 InVision:}
InVision\footnote{Website for InVision: \url{https://www.invisionapp.com/defined/prototype}} is a UI prototyping and collaboration platform that allows designers to create interactive and animated prototypes for web and mobile applications. 
It offers a range of features, including vector-based design tools, advanced animations and interactions, and an extensive library of pre-built UI components.
Its design tools are based on vector graphics, allowing for easy scaling and resizing of elements.
The platform also offers various commenting and annotation tools, making it easy for team members to communicate and collaborate on design decisions.
InVision also offers advanced animation and interaction capabilities, allowing designers to create complex, engaging interactions that simulate real-world user experiences. This feature includes support for animations, transitions, and gestures and the ability to create interactive elements such as buttons, menus, and forms.

\paragraph{\ac{ra}3 Axure:}
Axure\footnote{Website for InVision: \url{https://www.axure.com/prototype}} is another popular prototyping tool used in the industry. 
It is a wireframing and prototyping tool that allows designers to create complex interactions and dynamic content. 
With Axure, designers can create interactive prototypes with conditional logic, animations, and data-driven interactions. 
It also offers collaboration features, which enable teams to work together on the same project in real-time.
Its ability to handle complex logic and conditional interactions sets it apart from many other prototyping tools. 
However, the learning curve can be steep, and there may be better choices for designers looking for a quick and easy way to create simple prototypes.
Finally, Axure offers integrations with other design and collaboration tools, which can benefit teams using multiple tools in their workflow.

\paragraph{\ac{ra}4 Adobe XD:}
Adobe XD\footnote{Website for Adobe XD: \url{https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/learn/get-started-xd-prototype.html}} is a popular tool for designing and prototyping digital products, including websites, mobile apps, and other interactive experiences. 
It is widely used by UX designers, product managers, and other professionals in the design industry. 
One of the key features of Adobe XD is its ability to create interactive prototypes. 
With XD, designers can create clickable, interactive mockups of their designs, allowing them to test user flows and interactions before writing any code. 
These prototypes can also be shared with stakeholders and users for feedback.
In addition to prototyping, it is possible to integrate external plugins to conduct A/B testing in Adobe XD. 
One such plugin is UserTesting, which allows designers to recruit participants and set up tasks for A/B testing directly within Adobe XD. 

\paragraph{\ac{ra}5 Proto.io:} 
Proto.io\footnote{Website for Adobe XD: \url{https://proto.io/developers/}} is a powerful UI prototyping tool widely used in the industry. 
It offers a variety of features to create interactive prototypes, including the ability to add animations, transitions, and gestures. 
Proto.io provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface and supports multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, and the web.
One of the standout features of Proto.io is its ability to simulate the final product. 
This feature allows designers to create prototypes that look and feel like the final product, providing a more realistic user experience. 
Proto.io also provides advanced collaboration features, making sharing and collaborating on designs with team members and stakeholders easy.
Another key feature of Proto.io is its ability to create A/B tests. The tool offers a dedicated A/B testing feature, which allows designers to create multiple versions of a design and test them against each other. The tool also provides detailed analytics and user feedback, helping designers make informed design decisions.
