User Variety: The solution approach is required to have provisions that enable the integration of diverse types of users, both internal and external (e.g., tool users and crowd workers), so that developers can engage with various users during the evaluation process.

Split Testing: The solution approach is required to have provisions to create different versions of UI prototypes and conduct A/B testing to compare the performance of each version so that developers can make data-driven decisions about which UI design works best for their users.

The solution approach is required to have provisions to design the tool into minor, incremental phases in the software development process  so that developers can improve software delivery and make product changes and improvements based on customer feedback.

Pre-Designed UI Elements and Components: The solution approach is required to have provisions containing a library of pre-designed UI elements, such as buttons, menus, forms, and icons, that can be easily customized and used in the prototype so that developers can demonstrate how the UI will function.

User tasks Refinement: The solution approach is required to have provisions to create tasks that simulate real-world scenarios and workflows, with clear instructions and defined success criteria, and assign randomly to participants so that developers can collect and improve the UI prototype.

Diversity in Analytics and Metrics: The solution approach is required to have provisions for analytics and metrics so that developers can track the performance and behavior of the different UI prototypes being tested.

Modeling for Verification: The solution approach is required to have provisions for models that can be used to simulate the behavior of the UI prototype, so that developers can test its functionality and identify potential issues before the actual software is developed.

Qualitative Analysis: The solution approach is required to have provisions  for collecting and analyzing qualitative feedback from participants, such as comments, feedback forms, or opended questions so that developers can gain insights into the user experience and identify areas for improvement.

Quantitative Analysis: The solution approach is required to have provisions for quantitative analysis features so that developers can analyze and visualize data from A/B testing and other analytics, such as user behavior patterns, click heatmaps, and conversion rates.

Export Options: The tool should allow users to export the results of their split testing and analysis, in formats that can be easily shared with team members, stakeholders, or other tools.

User Management: The solution approach is required to have provisions for user management features that enable team members to create and manage user accounts, with different levels of access and permissions, to ensure data security and privacy.
